emission_limit:
# - [EMISSION, COUNTRY, TYPE, YEAR, VALUE]
# where VALUE is emissions in million tonnes of CO2-equivalent and YEAR is  
# when that constraint must be adhered to. All years between multiple emission 
# constraints will be interpolated if TYPE is set to "LINEAR". If "POINT" is used
# it means that a singular year value is set without interpolation occuring in
# previous target years. A combination of TYPE targets can be set per EMISSION and
# COUNTRY yet only a single target per YEAR.
# EXAMPLE: - ["CO2", "IND", "LINEAR", 2050, 0]

min_generation_factors:
# TECHNOLOGY: [VALUE, COUNTRY, YEAR]
# where VALUE is minimum utilization (PJ) of a given technology. This can be 
# used to constrain power plant output (generation), for example, to calibrate historical
# generation values.
# EXAMPLE:  OCG: [50, "IND", 2021]
  
max_availability_factors:
# [COUNTRY/NODE, TECHNOLOGY, START_YEAR, END_YEAR, VALUE]
# where VALUE is percentage (%) MAX availability of a given technology. This overwrites
# the default values from availability_factors.csv in resources/data. This parameter can
# be used to constrain the maximum output of technologies to, for example, mimic 
# max generation policy targets.
# EXAMPLE: - ["IND", 'COA', 2030, 2050, 25]
 
fossil_capacity_targets:
# [NODE, TECHNOLOGY, START_YEAR, END_YEAR, SENSE, VALUE]
# where VALUE is the absolute (GW) capacity constraint and SENSE sets the type of constraint.
# E.g. 'ABS' sets a fixed value, 'MIN' sets a minimum capacity value and 'MAX' sets a maximum
# capacity value. Note that in case 'ABS' or 'MAX' is applied, the given value needs to be 
# higher than the residual capacity of that technology in the given year otherwise the workflow
# will not complete. Targets can only be set at the nodal level.
# EXAMPLE: - ["INDNE", 'CCG', 2040, 2050, 'MIN', 10]

re_targets:
# TARGET: [COUNTRY/NODE, [TECHNOLOGY], START_YEAR, END_YEAR, VALUE]
# E.g. TO1: ["IND", [], "PCT", 2030, 2040, 60]
# E.g. TO2: ["INDSO", ['WOF', 'WON'], "PCT", 2025, 2045, 15]
# E.g. TO3: ["INDSO", ['WOF'], "ABS", 2040, 2050, 200]
# Targets can be set in absolute terms ("ABS", VALUE = GW) or in relative terms 
# ("PCT", VALUE = %) where targets in relative terms represent the share of generation.
# For "PCT", targets can be set at national (e.g. "IND") and nodal levels (e.g. "INDSO")
# whereas "ABS" can only be set at nodal levels. For "PCT", a single technology can 
# be set for the target (e.g. ["WOF"]) a technology subset can be set (e.g. ['WOF', 'WON'])
# or the TECHNOLOGY list can be left empty (e.g. []) as such that all renewable
# technologies contribute to the target. For "ABS", only one technology can be 
# selected per target. Note that a combination of targets can be set that affect
# the same countries/nodes/technologies. This can be computationally intensive.
