nodes_to_add:
 #- 'AAAXX' where AAA is a 3-letter country code, 
 # specified in the 'geographic scope' 
 # and XX is a 2-letter sub-regional node code. 
 # E.g. - 'IDNSM' for a sub-regional node in Sumatra, Indonesia.
 # - 'IDNSM'


nodes_to_remove:
#- 'AAAXX' where AAA is a 3-letter country code, and XX is a 2-letter 
# sub-national code

powerplant_build_rates:
 # TECHNOLOGY_TYPE: [COUNTRY, METHOD, VALUE, START_YEAR, END_YEAR, METHOD]
 # where TECHNOLOGY_TYPE is, for example, all coal powerplants and is in the 
 # format COA.
 # COUNTRY is the 3-letter country code. E.g. 'IDN' for 'Indonesia' 
 # METHOD specifies how the build rate is applied: absolute ('ABS' or as a 
 # percentage ('PCT') of the maximum capacity for a TECHNOLOGY_TYPE.
 # VALUE is the value - either absolute or percentage - by which the capacity 
 # of the associated TECHNOLOGY can increase. It is applied from the START_YEAR 
 # to the END_YEAR.
 # E.g. - ['SPV', 'IDN', 'ABS', 0, 2020, 2025]

emission_limit:
# - [EMISSION, COUNTRY, YEAR, VALUE]

# constraints will be interpolated.
 - ['CO2', 'IDN', 2040, 1]

fuel_limits:
# FUEL: [VALUE, COUNTRY/INTERNATIONAL, YEAR]
# Where FUEL is the fuel on which a limit is being applied (e.g. COA), VALUE is
# the value in Petajoules (PJ), COUNTRY/INTERNATIONAL specific which domestic 
# fuel (e.g. IDN) or international fuel ('INT') the limit is being applied to, 
# and YEAR is the year for which the limit is applied. All years between multiple 
# fuel extraction constraints will be interpolated.
